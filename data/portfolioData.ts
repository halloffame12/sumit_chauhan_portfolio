  title: "Full-Stack Developer | AI/ML Enthusiast",
  bio: `I am a passionate Full-Stack Developer and AI/ML student currently pursuing B.Tech in AI & ML at IITM Group of Institutions (Batch 2028). With expertise in modern web technologies, backend systems, and real-time applications, I specialize in building scalable, user-friendly, and feature-rich projects. 
  I enjoy solving complex problems, exploring new technologies, and creating innovative projects such as AI chatbots, real-time chat apps, gesture recognition systems, and interactive web platforms. 
  My goal is to reach a god-level of coding within 3 years and contribute to cutting-edge innovations in AI, space, and software engineering. 
  Outside of coding, I love exploring science, reading books, and working on creative ideas.`,
